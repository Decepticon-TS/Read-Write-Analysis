# Concurrent Website Status Analyzer


## üöÄ Project Overview
Welcome to the Website Checker project! This isn't just another programming exercise - it's a deep dive into the world of concurrent programming, network operations, and Python's powerful asynchronous capabilities.

## üìö Learning Objectives

By exploring this project, you'll gain insights into:

- Concurrent programming paradigms
- Network request optimization
- Performance analysis techniques
- Advanced Python programming concepts

üîç What Does This Project Do?
The Website Checker is a sophisticated tool that:

- Checks the status of multiple websites simultaneously
- Compares different methods of concurrent programming
- Generates performance metrics and visualizations
- Demonstrates intelligent URL generation and error handling



# üõ† Concurrent Programming Techniques Explored

1. **Sequential Checking**

- Concept: Traditional, one-by-one processing

2. **Parallel Checking**

*Technique: ThreadPoolExecutor*
- Faster than sequential
- Utilizes multiple CPU cores


3. **Asynchronous Checking**

*Technique: Asyncio*

- Most efficient for I/O-bound tasks
- Minimal resource overhead
- Non-blocking operations


- Advanced Concept: Event-driven programming

## üí° Code Architecture Highlights

### Intelligent Components

- `WebsiteChecker` class: Core checking logic
- Decorator-enhanced methods
- Type hinting for code clarity
- Configurable parameters

### Performance Tracking

- Detailed metrics collection
- Response time analysis
- Success rate calculation
- Visualization of performance data


# üî¨ Deep Dive: Concurrent Programming

## Why Concurrent Programming Matters

1. Performance: Faster processing of multiple tasks
1. Resource Efficiency: Better utilization of system resources
1. Scalability: Handle increasing workloads

### Asyncio vs Threading

**Asyncio:**

- Single-threaded
- Event loop based
- Excellent for I/O-bound tasks


**Threading:**

- Multiple threads
- True parallelism
- Better for CPU-bound tasks

## üìä Performance Metrics Explained
### What We Measure

- Total websites checked
- Successful connection rate
- Average/Median response times
- Execution time comparison

### Visualization Insights

- Pie chart of success rates
- Histogram of response time distribution
